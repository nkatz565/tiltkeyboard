	<h2>What is Tilt2Type?</h2>
		<p> Tilt2Type is a specialized user input for the Pebble Smartwatch; it was developed as an easy and quick way 
			to type on the Pebble watch without having to take out your phone. 
			By using accelerometers and buttons on the watch, the user can access an entire keyboard without a cluttered interface.</p>
	<h2>How to use Tilt2Type</h2>
		<p> The application has five sets of characters, each accessible by either tilting the Pebble 
			towards one of the four corners or holding it flat.
			There are nine characters per set; each triplet of characters is accessed by pressing the 
			corresponding button until the desired letter is highlighted. To backspace, simply shake the watch.</p>
	<h2>Potential Uses</h2>	
		<p> Tilt2Type has many possible uses; our demonstration utilizes the keyboard to allow users
			to search stock prices. By scraping the MarkitOnDemand API, our application is capable of obtaining
			current stock prices, highs, lows, and other information that users type in via Tilt2Type.  In order to search for
			a stock, type in the stock symbol and press and hold the middle button.</p>
